For each file that you have created there will be a separate html file created corresponding to its name. The webpage contains side-by-side assembly language and corresponding source code for a given program in a table. 

The output of commands llvm-dwarfdump and objdump â€‘d  is stored in a text file and using the table of line to assembly code we look into object dump to find the range of commands associated with a particular instruction. 

There is a separate array created for each file's llvm table content to separate the information.

For each address in the objdump we have added an id to it and anytime there is a callq or jmp (or other control flow instructions) an href tag is added to which makes it jump to the address required.
